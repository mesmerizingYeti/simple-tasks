**Technologies**
> React.js, Material-UI, Node.js, Express.js, Passport.js, MongoDB, Mongoose, Ubuntu, AWS
React.js and Material-UI were used to create and design the front-end of the application.  
I used Node.js and Express.js to create the server.
Passport.js allowed me to integrate google oauth2 authentication for my app with ease.
I chose to use MongoDB with Mongoose to create the database for simplicity.
In order to deploy the app, I used an Ubuntu server through Amazon Web Services.
